## Some logical operators - for data wrangling

-   We are going to use:

    -   == (does this match?)

    -   != (do these not match?)

    -   \>, \<, \>=, \<=

    -   &, \| (or),

    ```{r}
    library(tidyverse)
    ```

```{r}
#This is a question
#Does 4 match 5?
4 == 5

#Does 4 match 4?
4 == 4

#Does 4 not match 5?
4 != 5

#Does 4 not match 4?
4 != 4

#Does 4 match "4"?
4 == "4"

# With assigned variables?
cat <- 10
dog <- 7

cat > dog

#Is dog greater than can OR is cat less than 20?
dog > cat | cat < 20

#Is dog less than cat and cat = 10?
dog < (0.5 * cat)

#Is dog less than cat and cat greater than 2 and 4 greater dog?

dog < cat & cat > 2 & 4 >= dog
```

## Make a bubble chart for cars 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, size = mpg, color = wt)) + 
  geom_point(color = "pink") + 
  labs(x = "Car Weight (1000 lbs)", y = "Miles per Gallon", title = "Car weight efficiency relationship")
```
